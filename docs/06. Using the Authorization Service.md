# Using the Authorization Service

This section will teach you how to use the AuthorizationService to its full extent.

## Injecting the Authorization Service

### Using initializers

To automatically inject the authorization service into your classes, you can implement the
`AuthorizationServiceAwareInterface` and use the trait, as shown below:

```php
namespace YourModule;

use ZfcRbac\Service\AuthorizationServiceAwareInterface;
use ZfcRbac\Service\AuthorizationServiceAwareTrait;

class MyClass implements AuthorizationServiceAwareInterface
{
    use AuthorizationServiceAwareTrait;

    public function doSomethingThatRequiresAuth()
    {
        if (! $this->getAuthorizationService()->isGranted('deletePost')) {
            throw new UnauthorizedException('You are not allowed !');
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

Then, register the initializer in your config (it is not registered by default):

```php
class Module
{
    // ...

    public function getServiceConfig()
    {
        return [
            'initializers' => [
                'ZfcRbac\Initializer\AuthorizationServiceInitializer'
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

> While initializers allow rapid prototyping, their use can lead to more fragile code. We'd suggest using factories.

### Using delegator factory

ZfcRbac is shipped with a `ZfcRbac\Factory\AuthorizationServiceDelegatorFactory` [delegator factory]
(http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.3/en/modules/zend.service-manager.delegator-factories.html)
to automatically inject the authorization service into your classes.

As for the initializer, the class must implement the `AuthorizationServiceAwareInterface`.

You just have to add your classes to the right delegator :

```php
class Module
{
    // ...

    public function getServiceConfig()
    {
        return [
            'invokables' => [
                'Application\Service\MyClass' => 'Application\Service\MyClassService',
            ],
            'delegators' => [
                'Application\Service\MyClass' => [
                     'ZfcRbac\Factory\AuthorizationServiceDelegatorFactory',
                     // eventually add more delegators here
                ],
            ],
        ];
    }
}
```

> While they need a little more configuration, delegator factories have better performances than initializers.

### Using Factories

You can inject the AuthorizationService into your factories by using Zend's ServiceManager. The AuthorizationService
is known to the ServiceManager as `'ZfcRbac\Service\AuthorizationService'`. Here is a classic example for injecting
the AuthorizationService:

*YourModule/Module.php*

```php
class Module
{
    // getAutoloaderConfig(), etc...

    public function getServiceConfig()
    {
        return [
            'factories' => [
                 'MyService' => function($sm) {
                     $authService = $sm->get('ZfcRbac\Service\AuthorizationService');
                     return new MyService($authService);
                 }
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

### Using Zend\DI

DI is a great way for prototyping, getting results *fast* and maintaining a flexible structure. However it adds overhead and can get very slow. Unless you are using a compiler it is **not** recommended for production.
Here's how you enable Zend\DI to inject the AuthorizationService in MyClass:

*YourModule/Module.php*

```php
namespace YourModule;

class Module
{
    // getAutoloaderConfig(), etc...

    public function getConfig()
    {
        return [
            'di' => [
                'definition' => [
                    'class' => [
                        __NAMESPACE__ . '\MyClass' => [
                            'setAuthorizationService' => [
                                'required' => true
                            ]
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

## Permissions and Assertions

Since you now know how to inject the AuthorizationService, let's use it!

One of the great things the AuthorizationService brings are **assertions**. Assertions get executed *if the identity
in fact holds the permission you are requesting*. A common example is a blog post, which only the author can edit. In
this case, you have a `post.edit` permission and run an assertion checking the author afterwards.

### Defining assertions

The AssertionPluginManager is a great way for you to use assertions and IOC. You can add new assertions quite easily
by adding this to your `module.config.php` file:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'assertion_manager' => [
            'factories' => [
                'MyAssertion' => 'MyAssertionFactory'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

### Defining the assertion map

The assertion map can automatically map permissions to assertions. This means that every time you check for a
permission with an assertion map, you'll include the assertion in your check. You can define the assertion map by
adding this to your `module.config.php` file:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'assertion_map' => [
            'myPermission' => 'myAssertion'
        ]
    ]
];
```

Now, every time you check for `myPermission`, `myAssertion` will be checked as well.



### Multiple assertions

The assertion map also accepts multiple assertions as a simple array:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'assertion_map' => [
            'myPermission'  => 'myAssertion', // single assertion
            'myPermission2' => [              // multiple assertions
                'myAssertion',
                'myAssertion2'
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

Or with an additional condition definition:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'assertion_map' => [
             // single assertion
            'myPermission'  => 'myAssertion',
            'myPermission2' => [ 
                 // multiple assertions
                'assertions' => [
                    'myAssertion',
                    'myAssertion2'
                ], 
                // condition
                'condition' => \ZfcRbac\Assertion\AssertionSet::CONDITION_AND
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

If 'AND' condition is specified (this is default) all of the assertions must pass the check.
If 'OR' condition is specified at least one of the assertions must pass the check.
This in the background will create an instance of ZfcRbac\Assertion\AssertionSet and adds the given assertions to it.  

### Assertion Set

ZfcRbac\Assertion\AssertionSet class is basically a container for multiple assertions as well as assertion condition.
An instance of the class get's actually created automatically when you specify multiple assertions (see above) 
in the background, but you can also create your own instance containing your custom assertions 
and specify that in assertion map instead.

So you can create a factory for your assertion set like this for example:

```php

use Interop\Container\ContainerInterface;
use Zend\ServiceManager\FactoryInterface;
use Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceLocatorInterface;
use ZfcRbac\Assertion\AssertionSet;

class MyAssertionSetFactory implements FactoryInterface
{
    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     *
     * @return AssertionSet
     */
    public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container, $name, array $options = null)
    {
        $assertionManager = $container->get('ZfcRbac\Assertion\AssertionPluginManager');
        $assertion1 = $assertionManager->get('myAssertion1');
        $assertion2 = $assertionManager->get('myAssertion2');

        // create instance, set condition and add assertions
        $assertionSet = new AssertionSet([
            'assertions' => [$assertion1, $assertion2],
            'condition' => AssertionSet::CONDITION_OR
        ]);
        return $assertionSet;
    }
    
    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     *
     * For use with zend-servicemanager v2; proxies to __invoke().
     *
     * @param ServiceLocatorInterface $container
     * @return \ZfcRbac\Assertion\AssertionSet
     */
    public function createService(ServiceLocatorInterface $container)
    {
        // Retrieve the parent container when under zend-servicemanager v2
        if (method_exists($container, 'getServiceLocator')) {
            $container = $container->getServiceLocator() ?: $container;
        }

        return $this($container, AssertionSet::class);
    }
}

```

And then add it to assertion manager and assertion map config:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'assertion_manager' => [
            'factories' => [
                'myAssertionSet' => MyAssertionSetFactory::class
            ]
        ],

        'assertion_map' => [
            'myPermission'  => 'myAssertion', // single assertion
            'myPermission2' => 'myAssertionSet' // multiple assertions in set
        ]
    ]
];
```


### Checking permissions in a service

So let's check for a permission, shall we?

```php
$authorizationService->isGranted('myPermission');
```

That was easy, wasn't it?

`isGranted` checks if the current identity is granted the permission and additionally runs the assertion that is
provided by the assertion map.

### Checking permissions in controllers and views

ZfcRbac comes with both a controller plugin and a view helper to check permissions.

#### In a controller :

```php
    public function doSomethingAction()
    {
        if (!$this->isGranted('myPermission')) {
            // redirect if not granted for example
        }
    }
```

#### In a view :

```php
    <?php if ($this->isGranted('myPermission')): ?>
    <div>
        <p>Display only if granted</p>
    </div>
    <?php endif ?>
```

### Defining additional permissions

But what if you don't want to use the assertion map? That's quite easy as well!

Here are four examples of how to run an assertion without using the assertion map:

Disable the assertion:

```php
$authorizationService->setAssertion('myPermission', null);
$authorizationService->isGranted('myPermission');
```

Callback assertion:
```php
$something = true;

$authorizationService->setAssertion(
   'myPermission',
   function(AuthorizationService $authorization, $context = true) use ($something) {
      return $something === $context
   }
);

$authorizationService->isGranted('myPermission'); // returns true, when the identity holds the permission `myPermission`
```

Object implementing `AssertionInterface`:
```php
$context = true;

$authorizationService->setAssertion('myPermission', new MyAssertion($foo, $bar));
$authorizationService->isGranted('myPermission', $context);
```

Using the AssertionPluginManager:
```php
$context = true;
$authorizationService->setAssertion('myPermission', 'MyAssertion');
$authorizationService->isGranted('myPermission', $context);
```

*Please note: The context parameter is optional!*
