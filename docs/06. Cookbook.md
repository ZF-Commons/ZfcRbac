# Cookbook

This section will help you to further understand how ZfcRbac works by providing more concrete examples. If you have
any other recipe you'd like to add, please open an issue!

## A Real World Application

In this example we are going to create a very little real world application. We will create a controller `PostController` that interacts with a service called
`PostService`. For the sake of simplicity we will only cover the `delete`-methods of both parts.

Let's start by creating a controller that has the `PostService` as dependency:

```php
class PostController
{
    protected $postService;

    public function __construct(PostService $postService)
    {
        $this->postService = $postService;
    }

    // addAction(), editAction(), etc...

    public function deleteAction()
    {
        $id = $this->params()->fromQuery('id');

        $this->postService->deletePost($id);

        return $this->redirect()->toRoute('posts');
    }
}
```

Since we have a dependency, let's inject it using the `ControllerManager`, we will do this inside our `Module`-Class

```php
class Module
{
    // getAutoloaderConfig(), getConfig(), etc...

    public function getControllerConfig()
    {
        return [
            'factories' => [
                 'PostController' => function($cpm) {
                     // We assume a Service key 'PostService' here that returns the PostService Class
                     return new PostController(
                         $cpm->getServiceLocator()->get('PostService')
                     );
                 }
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

Now that we got this in place let us quickly define our `PostService`. We will be using a Service that makes use
of Doctrine, so we require a `Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager` as dependency.

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;

class PostService
{
    protected $objectManager;

    public function __construct(ObjectManager $objectManager)
    {
        $this->objectManager = $objectManager;
    }

    public function deletePost($id)
    {
        $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);
        $this->objectManager->remove($post);
        $this->objectManager->flush();
    }
}
```

And for this one, too, let's quickly create the factory, again within our `Module` class.

```php
class Module
{
    // getAutoloaderConfig(), getConfig(), etc...

    public function getServiceConfig()
    {
        return [
            'factories' => [
                 'PostService' => function($sm) {
                     return new PostService(
                         $sm->get('doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default')
                     );
                 }
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

With this set up we can now cover some best practices.

## Best practices

One mistake most beginners do is protecting their applications using guards only. This leaves your application open for
some undesired side-effects. As a best practice you should protect all your services by injecting the authorization
service. But let's go step by step:

Assuming the application example above we can easily use ZfcRbac to protect our route using the following guard:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'guards' => [
            'ZfcRbac\Guard\RouteGuard' => [
                'post/delete' => ['admin']
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

Now, any users that do not have the "admin" role will receive a 403 error (unauthorized) when trying to access
the "post/delete" route. However, this does not prevent the service (which should contain the actual logic in a properly
design application) to be injected and used elsewhere in your code. For instance:

```php
class PostController
{
    protected $postService;

    public function createAction()
    {
        // MUHAHAHA DOING SOMETHING EVIL!!!
        $this->postService->deletePost('2');
    }
}
```

You see the issue! The solution is to inject the `AuthorizationService` into your services, and checking for the
permissions before doing anything wrong. So let's modify our previously created `PostService`-class

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;

class PostService
{
    protected $objectManager;

    protected $authorizationService;

    public function __construct(
        ObjectManager        $objectManager,
        AuthorizationService $autorizationService
    ) {
        $this->objectManager        = $objectManager;
        $this->authorizationService = $autorizationService;
    }

    public function deletePost($id)
    {
        // First check permission
        if (!$this->authorizationService->isGranted('deletePost')) {
            throw UnauthorizedException('You are not allowed !');
        }

        $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);
        $this->objectManager->remove($post);
        $this->objectManager->flush();
    }
}
```

Since we now have an additional dependency we should inject it through our factory, again within our `Module` class.

```php
class Module
{
    // getAutoloaderConfig(), getConfig(), etc...

    public function getServiceConfig()
    {
        return [
            'factories' => [
                 'PostService' => function($sm) {
                     return new PostService(
                         $sm->get('doctrine.entitymanager.orm_default'),
                         $sm->get('ZfcRbac\Service\AuthorizationService') // This is new!
                     );
                 }
            ]
        ];
    }
}
```

Of course, you have to configure a permission provider so that the Rbac container is aware of this permission. In
your config, add the following code:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'permission_providers' => [
            'ZfcRbac\Permission\InMemoryPermissionProvider' => [
                'deletePost'  => ['admin']
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

For more information about permission providers, please refer to [this page](/docs/05. Permission providers.md).

### When using guards then?

In fact, you should see guards as a very efficient way to quickly reject access to a hierarchy of routes or a
whole controller. For instance, assuming you have the following route config:

```php
return [
    'router' => [
        'routes' => [
            'admin' => [
                'type'    => 'Literal',
                'options' => [
                    'route' => '/admin'
                ],
                'may_terminate' => true,
                'child_routes' => [
                    'users' => [
                        'type' => 'Literal',
                        'options' => [
                            'route' => '/users'
                        ]
                    ],
                    'invoices' => [
                        'type' => 'Literal',
                        'options' => [
                            'route' => '/invoices'
                        ]
                    ]
                ]
            ]
        ]
    ]
};
```

You can quickly unauthorized access to all admin routes using the following guard:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'guards' => [
            'ZfcRbac\Guard\RouteGuard' => [
                'admin*' => ['admin']
            ]
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Using dynamic assertions

Sometimes, using permissions alone is not enough. For instance, let's reuse the example for the previous part, more
specifically the `deletePost` method:

```php
public function deletePost($id)
{
    // First check permission
    if (!$this->authorizationService->isGranted('deletePost')) {
        throw UnauthorizedException('You are not allowed !');
    }

    $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);
    $this->objectManager->remove($post);
    $this->objectManager->flush();
}
```

This code protects your service so that only users that have the `admin` role can delete a post. However, this allows
*any* admin to delete *any* post. Instead, we want to make sure that only the admin author of a specific post can
delete its own post.

To handle this case, ZfcRbac allows you to specify assertions as the second argument of `isGranted` method. Assertions
can either be a callable (closure...) or any class that implements `ZfcRbac\Assertion\AssertionInterface`.

> The ZF2 RBAC component also comes with an interface for assertions (`Zend\Permissions\Rbac\AssertionInterface`). However,
you cannot not use it, as the signature is not the same (the ZF2 assertion interface does not give you access to the
`AuthorizationService`).

Each assertion gives you access to the current identity. Here is an example:

```php
public function deletePost($id)
{
    $post = $this->objectManager->find('Post', $id);

    $assertion = function(IdentityInterface $currentIdentity = null) {
        return $currentIdentity === $post->getAuthor();
    };

    // First check permission
    if (!$this->authorizationService->isGranted('deletePost', $assertion)) {
        throw UnauthorizedException('You are not allowed !');
    }

    $this->objectManager->remove($post);
    $this->objectManager->flush();
}
```

## Using ZfcRbac with Doctrine ORM

TBD

## How to lazy-load roles and permissions for very complex use cases?

In small to medium applications, you usually only have a few roles and permissions. To that extent, using the
built-in [role providers](/docs/04. Role Providers.md#built-in-role-providers)
and [permission providers](/docs/05. Permission Providers.md#built-in-permission-providers) is usually enough. For
instance, the `InMemoryRoleProvider` allows you to specify all your applications' roles into a PHP config array, while
the `ObjectManagerPermissionProvider` allows you to load all the permissions from a table.

However, this is not possible to store all roles/permissions in memory if you have thousands of them. In those cases,
you likely want to lazy-load only a subset of roles/permissions based on the matched roles and asked permission.

### Force the reload

By default, ZfcRbac only load roles and permissions one time to keep great performance. It happens the first time
`isGranted` method is called. However, if you have a lot of permissions, what you want is actually trigger a load
each time `isGranted` is called:

```php
$authorizationService->isGranted('editPost'); // Hit the database to load data
$authorizationService->isGranted('deleteAuthor'); // Hit again the database to load more data
```

To enable this behaviour, update your ZfcRbac config to enable force reload:

```php
return [
    'zfc_rbac' => [
        'force_reload' => true
    ]
]
```

### Creating custom role providers and permission providers

You now need to create custom role providers and permission providers.

To learn about how to create and register custom role providers, please [refer to this section](/docs/04. Role providers.md#creating-custom-role-providers).
To learn about how to create and register custom permission providers, please [refer to this section](/docs/05. Permission providers.md#creating-custom-permission-providers).

For instance, here is a permission provider that would load permissions from database only for the current user roles:

```php
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectRepository;
use ZfcRbac\Permission\PermissionProviderInterface;
use ZfcRbac\Service\RbacEvent;

class FilterPermissionProvider implements PermissionProviderInterface
{
    protected $objectRepository;

    public function __construct(ObjectRepository $objectRepository)
    {
        $this->objectRepository = $objectRepository;
    }

    public function getPermissions(RbacEvent $event)
    {
        $roles = $event->getRoles();

        return $this->objectRepository->findBy(['roles' => $roles]);
    }
}
```

## Using ZfcRbac and ZF2 Assetic

To use [Assetic](https://github.com/widmogrod/zf2-assetic-module) with ZfcRbac guards, you should modify your
`module.config.php` using the following configuration:

```php
return [
    'assetic_configuration' => [
        'acceptableErrors' => [
            \ZfcRbac\Guard\GuardInterface::GUARD_UNAUTHORIZED
        ]
    ]
];
```

## Using ZfcRbac and ZfcUser

To use the authentication service from ZfcUser, just add the following alias in your application.config.php:

```php
return [
    'service_manager' => [
        'aliases' => [
            'Zend\Authentication\AuthenticationService' => 'zfcuser_auth_service'
        ]
    ]
];
```
